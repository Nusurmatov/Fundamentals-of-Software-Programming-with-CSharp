In This Chapter
In this chapter we will review how to work with text files in C#. We will
explain what a stream is, what its purpose is, and how to use it. We will
explain what a text file is and how can you read and write data to a text
file and how to deal with different character encodings. We will
demonstrate and explain the good practices for exception handling when
working with files. All of this will be demonstrated with many examples in this
chapter.
Streams
Streams are an essential part of any input-output library. You can use
streams when your program needs to "read" or "write" data to an external
data source such as files, other PCs, servers etc. It is important to say that
the term input is associated with reading data, whereas the term output is
associated with writing data.
