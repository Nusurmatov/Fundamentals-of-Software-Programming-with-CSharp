/* (Difficult) Ex25 - Problem Statement:
*Write a program, which finds in a given matrix the largest area of
equal numbers. We define an area in the matrix as a set of neighbor
cells (by row and column). Here is one example with an area containing
13 elements with equal value of 3:
1 3 2 2 2 4
3 3 3 2 4 4 
4 3 1 2 3 3  --> 13
4 3 1 3 3 1
4 3 3 3 1 1
